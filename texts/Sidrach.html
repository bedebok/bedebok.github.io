    <h1>The Book of Sidrach</h1>
    <p>The <i>Livre de Sydrac le philosophe</i> is an anonymous encyclopedic text written in Old French (or possibly Provençal) in the late thirteenth century and later translated into multiple languages, including Middle Low German and Old Danish.</p>
    <p>The work is written as a dialogue between the Babylonian king <i>Boctus</i> and a wise philosopher named <i>Sidrach</i> (<i>Sydrak</i>, etc.). It is reminiscent of other encyclopedic dialgues, such as the twelfth-century <i>Lucidarius</i>, compiled under the auspices of Henry the Lion (<i>Heinrich der Löwe</i>) in Braunschweig ca. 1190.</p>
    <p>The French text of <i>Sidrach</i> was later translated into multiple European languages, including Italian (14th century), Dutch (14th?) and English (15th). A Low German translation is preserved in full in a manuscript from the end of the fifteenth century as well as a fragment from the sixteenth. Both of these manuscripts are held in and were possibly produced in Denmark. A Danish translation preserved in a manuscript from the second half of the fifteenth century likely derives from the Low German translation.
