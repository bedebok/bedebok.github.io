    <h1>The Book of Sidrach</h1>
    <p>The <i>Livre de Sydrac le philosophe</i> is an anonymous encyclopedic text written in Old French (or possibly Provençal) in the late thirteenth century and later translated into multiple languages, including Middle Low German and Old Danish.</p>
    <p>The work is written as a dialogue between the Babylonian king <i>Boctus</i> and a wise philosopher named <i>Sidrach</i> (<i>Sydrak</i>, etc.). It is reminiscent of other encyclopedic dialgues, such as the twelfth-century <i>Lucidarius</i>, compiled under the auspices of Henry the Lion (<i>Heinrich der Löwe</i>) in Braunschweig ca. 1190.</p>
    <p>The French text of <i>Sidrach</i> was later translated into multiple European languages, including Italian (14th century), Dutch (14th?) and English (15th). A Low German translation is preserved in full in a manuscript from the end of the fifteenth century as well as a fragment from the sixteenth. Both of these manuscripts are held in and were possibly produced in Denmark. A Danish translation preserved in a manuscript from the second half of the fifteenth century likely derives from the Low German translation.
      <h2>Meister Sydracks Bock</h2>
    <p>Copenhagen, Den Arnamagnæanske Samling, <a href="https://handrit.is/manuscript/view/en/AM04-0807/0#mode/2up">AM 807 4to</a> is a parchment manuscript containing the Book of Sidrach in Low German. According to a colophon at the end of the manuscript it was written "To copenhauen na godes ghebort dusent vierhundert also vort in dem LXXIX Jaer" (Copenhagen, AD 1479).</p>
    <p>The text opens with a list of the 387 questions which King Boctus poses to Sidrach (ff. 1r- ) while the main text begins on <a href="https://handrit.is/manuscript/view/en/AM04-0807/27?iabr=on#page/12v/mode/2up">f. 13r</a>.</p>
    <p>Árni Magnússon bought the manuscript from the auction of Frederik Rostgaard in 1726.</p>
    <p>A fragment of the Low German <i>Sidrach</i> is found in the manuscript Copenhagen, Det Kgl. Bibliotek, NKS 285 fol. The manuscript was produced in the sixteenth century and belonged to P. F. Suhm, whose manuscripts entered the Royal Library in 1798.</p>
